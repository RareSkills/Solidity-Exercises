        2. Create a variable of type UserInfo, named `userInfo`.
        3. Create a function called `setTuple` that takes in 
           a address and uint256 and sets the all values 
           the `userInfo` variable you created above.
        4. Create a function called `returnTuple`, 
           that returns `userInfo` (as a tuple)
