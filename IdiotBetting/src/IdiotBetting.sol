        This exercise assumes you know how block.timestamp works.
        - Whoever deposits the most ether into a contract wins all the ether if no-one 
          else deposits after an hour.
        1. `bet` function allows users to deposit ether into the contract. 
           If the deposit is higher than the previous highest deposit, the endTime is 
           updated by current time + 1 hour, the highest deposit and winner are updated.
        2. `claimPrize` function can only be called by the winner after the betting 
           period has ended. It transfers the entire balance of the contract to the winner.
