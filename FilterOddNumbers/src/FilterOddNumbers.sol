        This exercise assumes you understand how to manipulate Array.
        1. Function `filterOdd` takes an array of uint256 as argument. 
        2. Filter and return an array with the odd numbers removed.
        Note: this is tricky because you cannot allocate a dynamic array in memory, 
              you need to count the even numbers then declare an array of that size.
